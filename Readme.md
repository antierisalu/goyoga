Dockerized my daily yoga video picker.

Picks from the YogaWithAdriene this month's playlist today's video and redirects to the page with embed mode(no ads or suggestions).

Youtube api key(.json) is needed.

example:

https://yoga.matansa.ee

You Can have one click executable which opens browser, moves browser to necessary screen, changes audio output to correct device(for example tv or speakers), puts video fullscreen and disables captions. For that you need to edit [yoga.go](yoga.go), to set wanted screen and audio device and then build an executable.
